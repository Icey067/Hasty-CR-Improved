"""Re-drive the same IL_Replay matches through RoyaleSim, for a paired
fidelity comparison with our own engine (tools/redrive_bench.py).

Runs in the isolated RoyaleGym environment:

    .venvs/royalegym/Scripts/python.exe tools/royalesim_redrive.py --pair b2000

It reads the match tags from reports/redrive/<pair>.jsonl, so both engines
play exactly the same matches, and writes reports/redrive/<pair>_royalesim.jsonl
with the same columns the report reads (winner / crowns agreement, refusals).

How a match is played, kept as close to our harness as the API allows:
* decks dealt unshuffled in an order under which every recorded play was in
  hand (searched, as RoyaleImitate does), so a hand refusal means the engine's
  cycle disagreed, not that the start was unknown;
* every card at its recorded level and form (evolution / hero), towers at the
  match's most common card level, both sides on 6 starting elixir;
* each play at its recorded tick and native tile. RoyaleSim cannot be told to
  ignore elixir, so a play it refuses is counted and dropped rather than
  forced. That is a harder test than ours, which tops elixir up.
