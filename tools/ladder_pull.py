"""What top ladder is actually playing, from Supercell's own API.

Every policy this project has trained comes out strong against whatever it was
selected on and weaker against the rest. The last run held out at 93.5% against
the rule engine and 78.0% against meta decks, on a training diet that is half
rule engine and a hand-picked list of meta decks. This is where a real
opponent pool comes from: the Path of Legends leaderboard, then each of those
players' recent ranked battles, then the deck distribution that falls out.

Why this and not `tools/royale_scrape.py`: RoyaleAPI's replay endpoint is
blocked (see that module), its crawl needs a person to clear a checkbox, and
one sitting yielded 1,467 battles in twenty minutes. This is sanctioned, needs
no browser, and returns roughly thirty battles for every player on the
leaderboard. What it cannot give is the card-by-card timeline - the official
API exposes decks and results, not replays.

    python tools/ladder_pull.py --top 1000

The token is read from `.secrets/supercell_token`, which is gitignored. Keys
are bound to a single public IP, so a changed address fails every request with
`accessDenied.invalidIp` and the fix is to edit the key rather than the code.
